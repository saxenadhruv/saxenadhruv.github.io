            <h1>Shopify Fulfillment Network - Why it doesn’t work </h1>
<br>
<p><h1><u>What are the 3 big take-aways from this chapter? </u></h1> 
<br>
<ol start="1"><li>To be successful, Shopify Fulfillment needs to be a <b>better stand-alone product </b> by-itself to be successful. It is not. 
</li><li>Fulfillment is <b>not </b>a software margins business and requires having an intense operations mindset in the company. Shopify is a software company not used to building lower margin products.
</li><li>Operations is a people driven business. To build a great fulfillment experience you need to provide a consistency of service across the network. <b>Owning the Warehouse Operating software </b>inside the FCs is key. Automation is not the answer.
</li></ol>

<p><b>What is Shopify's Fulfillment Thesis?</b> </p><a id="what_does_SFN_do"></a>
<br>
<p>Shopify Fulfillment Thesis is : </p>
<ol start="1"><li>They have aggregated the demand side of merchants needing fulfillment.
</li><li> The supply side (FCs) will come to them as they can bring the demand to the supply side.
</li><li>To connect supply and demand - they will take a small margin from the transaction.
</li></ol>
<hr>
<p><b><u>Why is this different from Amazon Fulfillment?</u></b> </p><a id="what_is_AMZ"></a>
<br>
<p>No,  AMZ Fulfillment is much different .  </p>
<ol start="1"><li>Amazon has commoditized the brands on its platform.Brands come to AMZ as AMZ has the demand from the customer base. However these customers are <b>Amazon’s customers. </b>Brands follow AMZ ’s guidelines to be on their its platform as AMZ helps drive revenue by bringing customers for their products. 
</li></ol>

<ol start="2"><li>Providing AMZ fulfillment services allows AMZ to tightly manage the customer relationship and ensures that <b>AMZ doesn’t loose its connection with the end customer. </b>
This tight control on the customer is what makes AMZ successful and allows it to run AMZ fulfillment as a way to further strengthen its relationship  with the end customer by providing the end customer with a consistent fulfillment / delivery experience. Brands have no say interaction with the end customer. </li></ol>
</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><b><u>How is this AMZ playbook fundamentally different from SFN</u></b></p><a id="AMZ_vs_Shop"></a>
<br>
<p>	</p>
<ol start="1"><li>On Shopify, <b>the customer belongs to the brand </b>itself not Shopify. That is the entire foundation of Shopify - supporting independent brands. If Shopify Fulfillment is not a good product - ( delayed orders, order errors, missing inventory etc.)- the brand will switch to a better/different fulfillment solution as it impacts their customers and their brand reputation.
</li>

<li>Unlike Amazon, simply being on Shopify fulfillment <b>doesn’t make </b>the Shopify merchant sales volumes go up. So there is no intrinsic hook for a Shopify merchant to be on  Shopify fulfillment if the fulfillment experience/product is sub-par. 
</li>
<li>So Shopify fulfillment has to be a <b>stand-alone fundamentally better product</b> than every other company with a similar offering. The product here refers to the full stack “Fulfillment experience for the merchant ” which includes - Fulfillment operations ( receiving, picking, packaging, shipping ) +  Software . That is what merchants want - A great end to end fulfillment experience product  
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<p> <b><u>Is Shopify a better fulfillment product ? </u></b>  </p><a id="better_product"></a>
<br>
<b>No, It is not.  </b>

<h1> Chapter 2. Fulfillment requires an operations driven mindset </h1>
<ol start="1"><li>Thinking like a software company- currently Shopify believes that <u>everything (physical infrastructure, processes, technology) and everyone(people)</u> inside the FCs is modular and can be commoditized. Following this strategy, Shopify engineering team connects into the FC’s existing WMS using the WMS API and lets the FCs run their regular day to day operations for the Shopify merchants. </li> 
<li>This is a <b><u>de-centralized network</u> </b>where every FC runs independently by itself on its own system and there is no central WMS platform which is orchestrating the day to day operations <u>inside</u> the entire network. </li>
</li><li>	Every FC being structurally unique ( sq. Footage, physical infrastructure , headcount) will operate differently from every other FC in the network and follow its <b>own operating best practices/ SOP.  </b>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<br>
<h2>This is going to be a problem for merchants.<h2>
</li></ol>
<ol start="1"><li><u>As a merchant</u>, I want my supply chain to be predictable and have a consistent experience across the entire network regardless of whether I am in a Chicago SFN location or a NY SFN location.  
</li>

<li>Across the entire network , for a great fulfillment experience - SFN needs to be consistent on : 
<ul><li>			<u>Inbound inventory </u>needs to be received consistently the same way
<ul><li>				At receive - Do you count all products or count only a portion of the inventory 
</li><li>				Do you scan product barcodes at arrival / Do you scan in LOT codes
</li><li>				Do my products get dimensions during the receiving step or do  
<ul><li>				 How do my packaging preferences get sent to the FC? 
</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li>			<u>Post receiving</u>,product needs to be stowed into a similar type of location across the network 
<ul><li>				As a merchant - I pay differently for a shelf, bin, pallet. Who decides where to place my inventory? 
</li><li>				Inventory controls need to be in place - Do you spot check inventory once every 6 months or every quarter? 
</li></ul></li>

<li>			<u> Outbound Orders</u> need to be picked and packaged consistently 
<ul><li>				As a merchant , I pay differently based on the box used. 
</li><li>				Hence every SFN location must carry the <b>same set of standard boxes</b> across the network. 
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>This  operations/coordination problem will need to be solved by a central software deployed by Shopify inside every FC to run a centrally  managed and well coordinated networ</h2></p>
<ol start="1"><li>Shopify will have to revise its decision to not own its WMS inside the FCs. It will need to build a WMS layer and deploy it inside every partner FCs. <b>Shopify does not have this as yet.</b>
</li><li>Shopify will have to “dictate” the operations inside the FC against a centralized blueprint to ensure the same SOPs are being followed across the network. <b>Shopify has never run Operations. It doesn't know what a great blueprint looks like. </b>
</li></ol>
<hr>
<p><b>How do you build a great blueprint to make your network consistent in every day operations ?</b> </p>
<br>
<p>To build a centralized blueprint  to create standardization between the FCs , some of the inputs that SFN will need to provide it to the partner FCs :</p>
<ol start="1"><li>WOS / WMS ( which we already discussed)
</li><li>FC Blueprint :
</li></ol>
<ul><li>			FC physical infrastructure will need to be consistent ( naming conventions on bins, racks, shelves , Weighing scales , Scanning tools etc. , Standard boxes)  
</li><li>			Consistent processes (picking, packaging, labelling, carrier delivery , returns, inbound etc) will need to match for every location. 
</li></ul>
<p>	The best way to create a FC blueprint to enforce for the SFN partners : </p>
<ul><li>		As a company , run operations yourselves <u>at scale</u> , build a playbook and use the internal playbook for your SFN partners ~and/or
</li><li>		To short cut your way into the learnings - Hire experienced operations people who have done this before and use their knowledge to build the blueprint and then run the network on this blueprint.  
<ul><li>			The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louiskearns/">person</a> running Shopify fulfillment is a software engineer. 
</li><li>			<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-epting/">Thomas Epting</a> - The most seasoned operations person on their team ( number 2) has never run a network. UnCommon Goods was a single node operation in NY which is similar to ShipBob in 2015. 
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally - fulfillment is <u>not just</u> a software problem. Shopify Fulfillment will need a mindset and cultural shift to be an  operations focused company run with rigor to make money where the margin of error is little and the <b><u>operations margins are not software margins.</u></b> . The problem is - Shopify is not an operations company. It’s a software company. </p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<hr>
<p><b>Can’t Shopify automate everything with 6Rivers?</b> </p>
<br>
<ul><li>In the 3PL space, every 3PL with or without automation employs hundreds of employees to fulfill demand. 
<ul><li>	If everything could be automated - <b><u>AMZ will not be hiring 200K employees during COVID.</u></b> They instead will be spending money building more robots. But they cannot . So in-essence you will <b><u>always</u></b> need people. So this will always be a service based industry. 
</li><li>	Where-ever there are people - there are inconsistencies of service. To provide consistency of service - you need to remove the human decision making from the FC’s hands and have a consistency /centralized layer which links all your partners together. 
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>	</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 Rivers is not a centralized Warehouse Operating System layer . It is an automation layer which connects into the FC WMS to make employees more productive. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>	</p>
<br>
<ul><li>Also let’s look at what AMZ did post KIVA acquisition :  
<ul><li>	It shut down KIVA for other customers as it makes most sense to take Kiva’s  product roadmap and built it exactly to AMZ’s specifications. 
<ul><li>		In the short term - this hurt as KIVA no longer generated any revenue from its existing paying customers and hence AMZ got no returns on its invested dollars. 
</li><li>		However it was the best decision as KIVA could now build the capabilities  needed for Amazon’s network.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>If you look at what 6Rivers is doing - it is still operating its own product roadmap and building solutions which work for the broader 3PL warehouses. Its not focusing to only work for what is needed for Shopify network.  
</li><li>Speaking to 6Rivers founders - that was the implicit agreement for their  acquisition to Shopify - that they will continue to service the broader industry. 
</li></ul>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>What Shopify really needs to do with 6Rivers is to adopt the AMZ-KIVA playbook and build a a network wide solution which can be built for all its partner FCs . </p>
<p>These partner FCs are by the way - all different sizes and shapes and will never be able to uniformly install 6Rivers! .  </p>
<p>Hence <u>AMZ built the entire stack including the FCs</u> to deploy Kiva successfully. </p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<hr>
<p><b><u>So what’s the big take-away  :</u></b> </p>
<br>
<ol start="1"><li>Fulfillment will always be a service oriented business. Shopify is a software company building software products .
</li><li>Buying automation tools is not the answer . If it was - Amazon would have done it en-masse over 25 years. Amazon just hired 175K workers to keep up with demand.
</li><li>To remove the variability of service - you need to move the decision making up one level from the FC associate to the  software which they use to decide how they work. Hence owning the WOS and the WMS inside the FCs is key.  ShipBob has that.
</li></ol>
<hr>
<p><b><u>What are some great examples of running a service based network.</u></b> </p>
<br>
<ul><li>The best examples of <u>service based networks</u> are restaurant chains who have managed to scale using franchise locations while maintaining consistent standards  world wide. 
</li></ul>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>How do restaurants do that?  By running a centralized command and control network with strict process controls. </p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<ul><li>Restaurants make every node in their network be consistent.  This control all processes insides the restuarant : 
<ul><li>	POS Software 
</li><li>	Restaurant Ticketing Software 
</li><li>	The raw materials / ingredients for the food 
</li><li>	The restaurant hours
</li><li>	The operations SOP
</li><li>	Branding  - everything is controlled by corporate. 
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<br>
<ul><li>To build this above expertise - majority of successful restaurant chains ( McDonalds, Starbucks)  have locations which they own and operate to stay in-touch with the changing consumer needs and be able to consistently improve and keep adapting their SOPs . 
</li></ul>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Hotel chains servicing business travelers are another example.  Business travelers need a consistent experience across all Marriott locations. </p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<hr>
<p><b>What are some examples of processes and infrastructure to manage for a FC network .</b> </p>
<br>
<ul><li>Examples of processes and infrastructure to manage  : 
<ul><li>		<u>Physical Infrastructure</u>
<ul><li>			Raw Materials - <b>Standard boxes</b> ( this is big!) , Packaging material across the network.  
</li><li>			Supplies - IT infrastructure - Scanners, Weighing scales , Picking Carts 
</li><li>			Staffing plans, Demand planning.
</li><li>			Enforcing contracts and wage rates.  
</li></ul></li><li>		Processes : 
<ul><li>			Fulfillment Processes : What do FC associates work on next/ which decides the flow of work in the FC
<ul><li>				The processes you run inside the building are unique based on the size and scope of the merchant and the size/scale of the building. 
</li><li>				Receiving - What WROs to process ; how to process them ; where to place them.  
</li><li>				Stowing - How are locations named inside the FC to direct inventory 
</li><li>				What order to process next
</li></ul></li><li>			Merchant Care operations - how to read the information consistently across all locations. 
<ul><li>				<u>Exception Case Handling</u>
</li><li>				Communication to merchant from operations in the FC. 
</li><li>				Communication from merchant to operations teams. 
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
